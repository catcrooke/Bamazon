# Bamazon
This activity involves creating an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, the app can be programmed to track product sales across your store's departments and then to provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store. This involves saving and requiring the MySQL and Prompt npm packages in the files--the app will needs them for data input and storage.

Step 1 - In Terminal, run the following code:
node bamazonCustomer.js

Step 2- From the table that is displayed, choose the id of the item to be purchased and type it into the console and hit enter.

Step 3- Select the stock quantity of the item to be purchased and type it into the console and hit enter.

Step 4- Choose a quantity of an item that is available to see a successful purchase message. 

Step 5- Once the purchase message has been made, the program process ends. You can see this below.
